generate the same example of x64 assembly language as well

Certainly! Here's the same "Hello, World!" program written in x86_64 assembly language:

section .data             ; Data Section
    message db 'Hello, World!', 10  ; Define a string message terminated by newline character

section .text             ; Code Section
    global _start         ; Entry point for the program

_start:                   ; Start of the program
    mov     rax, 1       ; Syscall number for 'sys_write'
    mov     rdi, 1       ; File descriptor for standard output (stdout)
    mov     rsi, message ; Pointer to the message
    mov     rdx, 13      ; Length of the message
    syscall              ; Call kernel (syscall)

    mov     rax, 60      ; Syscall number for 'sys_exit'
    xor     rdi, rdi     ; Exit status (0 for success)
    syscall              ; Call kernel (syscall)

Now, let's go through each line and explain what happens:

    section .data: This line defines the start of the data section, where constants or variables are declared.

    message db 'Hello, World!', 10: This line defines a string variable named message and initializes it with the string "Hello, World!" followed by a newline character.

    section .text: This line defines the start of the code section, where the actual instructions of the program reside.

    global _start: This line declares _start as the entry point of the program.

    _start:: This is a label indicating the start of the program.

    mov rax, 1: This instruction moves the value 1 into the rax register. In x86_64 assembly, 1 represents the syscall number for the sys_write function.

    mov rdi, 1: This instruction moves the value 1 into the rdi register. 1 represents the file descriptor for standard output (stdout).

    mov rsi, message: This instruction moves the memory address of the message variable into the rsi register. This is the address of the string we want to print.

    mov rdx, 13: This instruction moves the value 13 into the rdx register. This represents the length of the string we want to print ('Hello, World!' contains 13 characters including the newline).

    syscall: This instruction generates a software interrupt, causing the CPU to transfer control to the kernel. The kernel then handles the system call specified by the values in the registers rax, rdi, rsi, rdx, etc. In this case, it invokes the sys_write syscall to print the message to the standard output.

    mov rax, 60: This instruction moves the value 60 into the rax register. 60 is the syscall number for the sys_exit function, which is used to exit the program.

    xor rdi, rdi: This instruction XORs the rdi register with itself, effectively setting it to 0. This is the exit status of the program, indicating success.

    syscall: This instruction again generates a software interrupt, invoking the kernel to perform the sys_exit syscall and terminate the program.

This x86_64 version of the program is similar to the x86 version but uses 64-bit registers (rax, rdi, rsi, rdx, etc.) and the syscall instruction for system calls instead of int 0x80.
